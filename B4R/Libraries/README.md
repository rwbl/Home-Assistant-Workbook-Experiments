# B4R Additional Libraries

This folder contains external B4R libraries required for specific experiments in the **Hawe** project.  
These libraries must be present in your **B4R additional libraries path** to ensure successful compilation and deployment.

> **Note:** B4R does not automatically download dependencies. You must manually copy required libraries to the appropriate folder, typically found at:  
> `Documents\B4X\AdditionalLibraries\B4R\Libraries`

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the contents of this folder to your B4R Additional Libraries folder:
   - **Windows default**: `C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\B4X\AdditionalLibraries\B4R\Libraries`
3. Restart the B4R IDE if it was open.
4. Open the related experiment (e.g., `hawe_sht20`) and compile.

## Creating Your Own Library

If you're building a custom experiment that uses a C++ library, you can wrap it using a `.h` and `.cpp` file pair and expose it through the B4R community.
See existing libraries like `rSHT20` as a reference.
