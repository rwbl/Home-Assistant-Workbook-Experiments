# Hawe ‚Äì Home Assistant Workbook Experiments

**Hawe** (short for **Home Assistant Workbook Experiments**) is an open, hands-on learning project designed to explore and experiment with micro-controllers and connected components ‚Äî with a focus on learning **MicroPython**, **B4R**, and integrating with **Home Assistant**.

> üõ†Ô∏è **This is a Work in Progress**  
> I'm learning by doing ‚Äî this project grows as I explore new hardware, tools, and ways to integrate with Home Assistant.  
> Expect things to change, get reorganized, or improved over time.  
> If you're experimenting too, feel free to fork and reuse!

This workbook is a practical guide for makers, tinkerers, and hobbyists who want to:

- Build and simulate smart devices (e.g., environment sensors, LEDs, LCDs, switches)  
- Integrate devices into **Home Assistant** using **MQTT** (manual or via MQTT Autodiscovery)  
- Structure modular, reusable firmware using **MicroPython**, **B4R**, and other platforms  
- Extend experiments across multiple platforms including Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32, and desktop helpers

## About This Project

I created this project to deepen my understanding of **MicroPython**, **MQTT**, **Home Assistant**, and multi-platform embedded development ‚Äî experimenting with microcontrollers such as the **Raspberry Pi Pico 1 & 2 W** and **ESP32**, as well as desktop helpers using **B4J**.

The project combines:

- Firmware examples in **MicroPython** (primarily for RP2040-based boards)  
- ESP32 projects using **B4R** (Basic4Arduino) for expanded capabilities  
- Java-based helper tools built with **B4J** to aid development and debugging  
- Integration techniques for Home Assistant using MQTT and related automation

## Structure and Naming Conventions

### Experiments

Each experiment resides in its own folder containing firmware, MQTT topic definitions, and optionally Home Assistant config files.

**Example folder structure MicroPython experiment:**

```
14-Hawe_SHT20/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py           # Experiment firmware code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets.py        # Wi-Fi & MQTT credentials (user edited)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ connect.py        # Network & MQTT connect logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py          # LED and utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Experiment documentation
```

### Naming Conventions

| Type                | Convention                       | Example                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Project             | `Hawe`                           | Home Assistant Experiments Workbook |
| Experiment          | `HaWe_Env`, `HaWe_SHT20`         | HaWeEnv (Env sensor), etc.          |
| HA Entities         | `sensor.hawe_sht20_temperature`  | Follows experiment name             |
| MQTT Topic Base     | `hawe_<exp>_<property>`          | `hawe/env/temperature`              |
| Code Modules        | `HaWe_Env.py`, `HaWe_SHT20.py`   | Modular by design                   |

## MQTT Integration

MQTT is the main communication protocol between devices and Home Assistant.

### MQTT Autodiscovery

**Example:** Create a switch called `testswitch`

Entity configuration topic & payload.

**Topic:**
```
homeassistant/switch/hawe_testswitch/config
```

**Payload:**
```json
{
    "name": "Hawe Test Switch",
    "default_entity_id": "testswitch",
    "unique_id": "testswitch",
    "state_topic": "hawe/testswitch/state",
    "command_topic": "hawe/testswitch/set",
    "payload_on": "1",
    "payload_off": "0",
    "device_class": "switch",
    "device": {
        "identifiers": [
            "hawe_device_18"
        ],
        "name": "HaweDevice"
    }
}
```
_Note:_ In older Home Assistant versions the `object_id` is used instead `default_entity_id`.

**MQTT commands:**
```bash
# Publish auto-discovery config
mosquitto_pub -h <broker_ip> -u <user> -P <pass> -t "homeassistant/switch/hawe_testswitch/config" -m '{...}' -r

# Monitor switch state
mosquitto_sub -h <broker_ip> -u <user> -P <pass> -t "hawe/testswitch/state" -v

# Remove switch from HA
mosquitto_pub -h <broker_ip> -u <user> -P <pass> -t "homeassistant/switch/hawe/testswitch/config" -n -r
```

### Manual MQTT Setup via YAML

Add to `hawe/mqtt/switches.yaml`:
```yaml
- name: "Hawe Test Switch"
  default_entity_id: "hawe_test_switch"
  unique_id: "hawe_test_switch"
  state_topic: "hawe/testswitch/state"
  command_topic: "hawe/testswitch/set"
  payload_on: "1"
  payload_off: "0"
  device_class: "switch"
  device:
    identifiers: ["hawe_device_18"]
    name: "HaweDevice"
```

Then reload MQTT and check your entities in Home Assistant.
