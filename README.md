# Hawe – Home Assistant Experiments Workbook

**Hawe** (short for **Home Assistant Experiments Workbook**) is an open, hands-on learning project designed to explore and experiment with microcontrollers and connected components — with a focus on learning **MicroPython** and integrating with **Home Assistant**.

This workbook is a practical guide for makers, tinkerers, and hobbyists who want to:

- Build and simulate smart devices (e.g., environment sensors, LEDs, LCDs, switches)  
- Integrate devices into **Home Assistant** using **MQTT** (manual or via MQTT Autodiscovery)  
- Structure modular, reusable firmware using **MicroPython**  
- Extend experiments to other platforms like ESPHome or B4R  

## ℹ️ About This Project

I created this project to deepen my understanding of **MicroPython**, **MQTT**, and **Home Assistant**, and to explore and tinker with microcontrollers such as the **Raspberry Pi Pico, Pico 2 WH** and **ESP32**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is developed for **personal, educational use only**.  
All experiments and code are provided _as-is_ and should be used **at your own risk**.  
Always test thoroughly and exercise caution when connecting hardware components or integrating with Home Assistant.

## 📦 Structure

### Experiments

Each experiment lives in its own folder, containing firmware, MQTT topic definitions, and optionally Home Assistant config.

Example:

```plaintext
14-Hawe_SHT20/
├── main.py           # Experiment firmware code
├── secrets.py        # Wi-Fi & MQTT credentials (user edited)
├── connect.py        # Network & MQTT connect logic
├── utils.py          # LED and utility functions
├── README.md         # Experiment documentation
```

## 📘 Naming Conventions

| Type                | Convention                       | Example                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

### 🧾 YAML Structure

Sensor, switch, and binary sensor configurations live in YAML files included from your configuration.yaml.
These files are created and edited using Home Assistant's File Editor.

**Example File Structure**
```
homeassistant/
└── hawe/
    ├── mqtt/
    │   ├── switches.yaml
    │   └── binary_sensors.yaml
    └── sensors/
        └── sensors.yaml
```

Include these in configuration.yaml under their respective domains
**Example configuration.yaml**
``` 
sensor: !include hawe/sensors/sensors.yaml
mqtt:
  binary_sensor: !include hawe/mqtt/binary_sensors.yaml
  sensor: !include hawe/mqtt/sensors.yaml
  switch: !include hawe/mqtt/switches.yaml
``` 

Each of the included YAML files should contain a list of entities, like:

**switches.yaml**
``` 
# hawe/mqtt/switches.yaml
- name: "My MQTT Switch"
  state_topic: "hawe/device1/status"
  command_topic: "hawe/device1/set"
  payload_on: "ON"
  payload_off: "OFF"
  state_on: "ON"
  state_off: "OFF"
  qos: 1
``` 

#### Example: Other Sensor Definition
This is not an MQTT sensor!
**configuration.yaml**
```yaml
# Include the Hawe sensors (no MQTTAD)
sensor: !include hawe/sensors/sensors.yaml
```

**sensors.yaml**
```yaml
# HaWeEnv sensor definitions
- platform: template
  sensors:
    haweenv_last_update:
      friendly_name: "HaWeEnv Last Update"
      value_template: >
        {{ [states.sensor.haweenv_temperature.last_updated,
            states.sensor.haweenv_humidity.last_updated,
            states.sensor.haweenv_pressure.last_updated]
           | max
           | as_timestamp
           | timestamp_custom('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', true)
        }}
```

**Dashboard Card: Hawe Environment**
```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: sensor.haweenv_temperature
    secondary_info: entity-id
  - entity: sensor.haweenv_humidity
    secondary_info: entity-id
  - entity: sensor.haweenv_pressure
    secondary_info: entity-id
  - entity: sensor.haweenv_last_update
title: Hawe Environment
```

## 📡 MQTT Integration

MQTT is used for communication between the MCU and Home Assistant.

### MQTT Autodiscovery

Example: Create a switch called `testswitch`

**Topic**
Topic
```
homeassistant/switch/hawe_testswitch/config
```
**Payload**
```
{
    "name": "Hawe Test Switch",
    "object_id": "testswitch",
    "unique_id": "testswitch",
    "state_topic": "hawe/testswitch/state",
    "command_topic": "hawe/testswitch/set",
    "payload_on": "1",
    "payload_off": "0",
    "device_class": "switch",
    "device": {
        "identifiers": [
            "hawe_device_18"
        ],
        "name": "HaweDevice"
    }
}
```

**MQTT Commands**
```bash
# Publish auto-discovery config
mosquitto_pub -h <broker_ip> -u <user> -P <pass> -t "homeassistant/switch/hawe_testswitch/config" -m '{...}' -r

# Monitor switch state
mosquitto_sub -h <broker_ip> -u <user> -P <pass> -t "hawe/testswitch/state" -v

# Remove switch from HA
mosquitto_pub -h <broker_ip> -u <user> -P <pass> -t "homeassistant/switch/hawe/testswitch/config" -n -r
```

### MQTT Manual Setup via YAML

Add to `hawe/mqtt/switches.yaml`:
```yaml
# HaWe Experiment: Switch
- name: "Hawe Test Switch"
  object_id: "hawe_test_switch"
  unique_id: "hawe_test_switch"
  state_topic: "hawe/testswitch/state"
  command_topic: "hawe/testswitch/set"
  payload_on: "1"
  payload_off: "0"
  device_class: "switch"
  device:
    identifiers: ["hawe_device_18"]
    name: "HaweDevice"
```

Then:
1. Go to **Developer Tools > YAML > Check configuration**
2. Use **Developer Tools > Actions > MQTT: Reload**
3. Navigate to **Settings > Devices & Services > Entities**, search for "Hawe", verify entity

### Quick Start (Thonny)

- Download and extract the hawe_main.zip from GitHub to a local folder.
- Open the MicroPython folder containing experiments.
- Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W to your computer.
- Copy the contents of MicroPython/Imports to the Pico using Thonny’s file manager or an external file manager.
- Open Thonny IDE and edit secrets.py with your Wi-Fi and MQTT credentials.
- Open an experiment (e.g., HaWeEnv/main.py) in Thonny.
- Connect the required hardware modules as per the wiring diagrams.
- Run the experiment script using Run > Run current script (F5)

## 💡 Why Use MicroPython?

- Easy-to-read syntax (ideal for beginners)
- Visual flow and modular code structure
- Resource-efficient on microcontrollers
- Great for structured experiments

## 🛠️ Future Topics

- Custom MQTT-based HA devices or HA Custom Component
- B4R equivalents of selected Hawe experiments
- Manual vs auto MQTT configuration
- BLE sensors (e.g., BMP280, VL53L0X)
- ESPHome integration options
